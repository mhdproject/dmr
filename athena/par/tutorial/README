Instructions to set up tests with the diffusion equation and 
induction equation.
------------------------------------------------------------

If not VAR_DT
 1. set NVAR = 2
 2. If `EDGE' test then set NFACEVAR = 2, otherwise 0

If VAR_DT then
 1. Set NPHASE in the appropriate advance routine 
 2. set NVAR consistently with NPHASE
 3. For any `EDGE' tests set NFACEVAR non-zero and consistent with NPHASE
    otherwise set to zero


Define CONSERVE

Set NFLUXVAR = 2

If `EDGE' set NEDGEVAR=2


make_tutor_npgc_*
make_tutor_vdt_npgc_*
---------------------
  Conservation check :  variable 1 total should be 584.0
                        variable 2 total should be 1168.0




For all EDGE tests, check to see if the gfacevar.dbg file has been
generated. If it has then div B is not zero everywhere.
Also check the value of max div B.
