The tests programs in this directory can be used to verify
that the package has been installed correctly. To run the
default tests do the following:


From the top level README:

     make check

     You should see the following three lines as the result of 'make check'

Note
----
Generally speaking these tests build upon each other, with each
successive test repeating and extending the tests of the previous
test. The sequence, from simplest to most comprehensive is
10. guardcell_1blk
20. prolong_1blk
30. c_to_f_1blk
31. test_1blk_guardcell_icoord
32. prolong_multilevel_1blk
33. checkpoint
35. restrict_1blk
40. flux_conserve_1blk
50. edges_1blk
60. multi_level_1
60. multi_level_2
60. multi_level_3



Brief Description of Tests
---------------------------

10. guardcell_1blk
Tests basic guardcell filling with no refinement discontinuities.

20. prolong_1blk
Refines grid from previous test by 1 or 2 levels and prolongs solution onto
new grid.

30. c_to_f_1blk
Introduces refinement discontinuities and tests guardcell filling.

31. test_1blk_guardcell_icoord
Tests guardcell filling in individual coord directions

32. prolong_multilevel_1blk
Tests case in which neighboring blocks at different refinement levels
are refined at the same time.

33. checkpoint
Writes and then reads back a checkpoint file and compares restart setup
with original data

35. restrict_1blk
Tests restriction operation.

40. flux_conserve_1blk
Tests amr_flux_conserve

50. edges_1blk
Tests amr_edge_average

60. multi_level_X
Tests different grids with multiple root blocks. All these tests should
be run for N_DIM == 3 only.
   X = 1 tests a 12x1x1 grid between -6 < x < +6, with centre refined twice
   X = 2 tests a 1x8x8 grid. 
   X = 3 tests a 192x1x1 gridi. maxblocks should be 120. This is designed
         to test the routine mpi_amr_reorder_grid.



Additional Tests
----------------

Edit ../source/amr_prolong.F and ../mpi_source/mpi_amr_prolong.F and
define MULTIBLOCK_TEST_2D. Then configure with N_DIM == 2.
Run only the test_prolong_multilevel_1blk test. This will check to
make sure that the FORCE_CONSISTENCY_AT_SRL_INTERFACES and
the amr_prolong_fc_divbconsist patch are working together properly.
