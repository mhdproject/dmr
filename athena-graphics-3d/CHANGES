p3.2                                                     Date 03/??/02

1. Fixed graphics so that lgraph and lmove are independant, almost.
   This eliminates lonscreen.  When both are set, images and graphics
   are produced at steps the lesser of nmovie or nstep_graphics.

2. Added 3D graphics.

3. Adds make_pivot which is a makefile front end for building
   athena on the beowulf cluster for on multiple processors.

4. The 3D graphics works on one processor
   and the graphics is now a seperate application, athena_graphics, 
   which receives signals from athena.  The reason for this is that
   you cannot have graphics on a beowulf cluster.  Nor, can you spawn
   a graphic subprocess from an mpi application.

   Tested with mpif90.gm.  See make_linux-3d.  The graphic interface
   works but the application doesn't.

5. Eliminated two files in paramesh_mods/headers.  The files removed
   are: paramesh_dimensions.F and physicaldata.F.  These files are
   no longer needed by the application.

6. Works for one processor linking with paramesh-may-01-2002 (pre 3.0).
   Eliminated paramesh_mods/headers/tree.F.  The program DOES NOT link
   with an earlier version of paramesh.  Also, paramesh-may-31-2002.

7. 04/02/02 = Runs for about 1200 time steps on 32 processors with graphics,
   then bombs out.

8. Added module_athena_specific_parameters.F and fixed building on IRIX.
   Also, fixed a preprocessor problem with INTERACTIVE_GRAPHICS.

9. Renamed preprocessor.fh to athena_preprocessor.fh.

10. Added read_control.F and placed the call in the main loop so that
    modifications to 'athena.control' will take effect on the next loop
    iteration.  So, changing the frequency of image generation or
    graphic updates is facilitated.

11. Changed building to used autoconf and automake.

    setup
    configure
    make
    cd application

Then,

    athena_graphics &  (optional)
    mpirun -np 2 athena
  
Or, on a Linux cluster

    Pcp athena `pwd`   - Provided the directory structure is the same
                         on all nodes.  'Psh mkdir `pwd`.   You may
                         need to, only once:
                             Psh mkdir proj
                             Psh mkdir proj/athena-grahpics-3d
                             Psh mkdir proj/athena-grahpics-3d/application

    athena_graphics &  (optional)
    mpirun -np 2 athena

pre-v3.1-4                                               Date 03/20/02

pre-v3.1-3                                               Date 02/??/02

1. Link w/ paramesh-v2.4

----------------------------------------------------------------------
pre-v3.1-2                                               Date 02/12/02

   *********************************
   *** DO NOT USE THE jhm BRANCH ***
   *********************************

1. Link with paramesh-pre-v2.3 or greater.

2. fixed the boundary condition. 

3. This is the merge of branch jhm3_1 which is a branch of jhm.
   The jhm and jhm3_1 branches are no longer needed.

   It is only necessary to check out athena with:
 
      cvs co athena

   In the unlikely event you wish to check out the branchs,
   mentioned above,  do the following:

      cvs co -r jhm3_1 -d athena-jhm3_1 athena

   It will create a directory called 'athena-jhm3_1'  (the argument to
   the -d option) and it will use the branch 'jhm3_1' (the -r option).
   Go to the directory 'athena-jhm3_1' and make any changes you like.
   When you commit, you will be committing changes to the branch 'jhm3_1'.
   Later, when things are working well, I will merge the changes
   into the mainline of athena.

4. Added -extend_source to compile flags.

5. Added config_paramesh script to copy headers and build paramesh.

6. Problem compiling brackbill_src_term.F.  For some reason I must
   include the file 'amr_shmem.fh' verbatim instead of using 
   the '#include' C preprocessor directive.  Compilier bug?

7. Added off screen rendering.  This links and runs with Mesa version 
   2.5.1 and above.  As of 1/8/02, off screen color does not work
   with Mesa 2.5.1. It does work with Mesa 3.4.2 in
   /usr/local/{include,lib}/Mesa-3.4.2.  But, those objects are 32 bit.
   You can't compile with '-64'.  You must build paramesh similiarly.
   I have made 'config_paramesh32' for that purpose.

8. Seems to work on Linux.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Minor changes in amr_1blk_bcset.F, amr_test_refinement.F

2. Minor changes in mhd3d.F

----------------------------------------------------------------------
v3.0                                                      Date 8/23/01

Initial release of Athena 3.0.

This code compiles against paramesh-pre2.1-6 on the SGI only (known).
