BOUNDARY CONDITIONS NEED TO BE SET SO THAT INFLOW MAINTAINED INSIDE FINITE APERTURE OF LOWER Y
AND REFLECTIVE BCS AWAY FROM APERTURE

jet paramters assigned to common block in athena.F:
     common/jet_state/jet_den, jet_p, jet_vy,jet_radius, jet_beta,
     .     ambient_den, ambient_vy, ambient_p

NB: Jet radius is rounded to integer number of fine grid cell spacings

Jet inflow assumed to be centered on 0,0

Identifier for new boundary condition is "-40" 

Control mainly in amr_1blk_bcset.F. Some inherited quantities assigned in athena.F 
and amr_initial_jet.F.

Refinement testing done on density. Hardwired into amr_test_refinement (ibc_work = 1).

Force full refinement around inflow aperture in box of dimension 2.0*jet_radius
athena.F:

CYYC              force refinement around jet inflow aperture
                  r=2.0*jet_radius
